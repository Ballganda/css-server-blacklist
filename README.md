# CS:S-server-blacklist

This is my server blacklist file to block the giant cess pool of fake servers that started to appear is CS:S in 2023  

I will update as I notice my browser filling up again with trash.

 #Installation/import

Recommended method is to import this list into your game. This will add to any blacklisting you may have already done.  
Download the "server_blacklist.txt" file from here to a location you remember. Can delete the file after import  
Open CS:S  
Open the server browser  
Go to the "Blacklisted Servers" tab  
At the lower right click the button for "Import servers from file"  
Select the "server_blacklist.txt" file you downloaded and import it  
Done  
Can now delete the txt file you downloaded from here  

FYI:  
The "server_blacklist.txt file used/saved by CS:S lives in the CS:S games cfg folder found on windows installs at "Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike\cfg"
